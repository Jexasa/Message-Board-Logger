# Message-Board-Logger
A Python web app that allows users to leave messages for an admin via a simple interface, while discreetly logging keystrokes for educational purposes. Built with Flask, it uses ngrok for public access, generates a QR code for the URL, and provides an admin dashboard to view logs.
